MonitorToDMX is a Blazor Hybrid web-app that outputs lighting data through a DSD TECH SH-RS09B USB-to-DMX interface. It replicates on-screen colour by assigning light fixtures to the average colour of defined screen partitions, or using a global average colour for the entire display.

This program was initially built for my own setup of cheap UKing fixtures, later evolving into a C# Console app for the light fixtures in the ALT (Edge) Theatre of the University of Bath.
